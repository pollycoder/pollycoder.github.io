<font color=pink><big><b>This is Polly's mind palace, mainly for tech-notes taking and sharing.</b></big></font>

> Here, these things are welcome:
1. Reading Polly's blog and sharing your opinion in comment area.
2. Reading Polly's blog and giving objective advice personally.
3. If you think some part of my blog is useful, quote it in your work (Don't forget honor code ! You have to include the source, which is the url of my blog.) or share it with other tech-fans.
{: .prompt-tip }

> However, these things are not quite acceptable:
1. Making unrelated comments----this is quite time-wasting I'm sorry to say.
2. Use my blog to show off in front of others (actually Polly hates showing off, especially when I make a subtle mistake !)
{: .prompt-warning }

> Last but not least, these things is NOT acceptable at all:
1. Making abusing comments, no matter on the author or other commneters.
2. Copying my blog without quote the source (copyright is very important!)
{: .prompt-danger }
