### Problom 1 Wrong number

#### Original Problem:

Give you a string, extract all the negative numbers from the string.

e.g. (Source code: https://oj.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/course/8/contest/170/problem/0)

Input:

```console
This line contains 1 integer "one".
This line contains no integer.
233, next line is empty.

If you got -123.456, you should output 123 and 456.
Any digit string are considered integers, like 0123456 and 007.
You may also need to consider cases like a0a12a345a6789a.
```

Output:

```console
1

233

123 456 123 456
0123456 007
0 12 345 6789
```

#### Solution:

1. The main idea of the source code:

   Find the first number of each string, then find the last number of the string, here we have a total number string.

   Decide whether it is the first string, if not so, output a SPACE.

2. Bugs in the idea of the sorce code:

(1) The source code didn't initialize the bool-type variable.

(2) The source code mistakes the ASCII code between character and number:

`'0'-'9' VS 0-9 `

3. My solution

   I chose to judge whether the number string is the last one (because I'm accustomed to output a space behind a string [Facepalm])

My source code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (string str; getline(cin, str); ) {
        bool if_final = true;
        
        size_t length = str.size();
       /*********************************************************************************************************************
        * Judge whether the character is a number.
        * If so, find the last number following it.
        * Find out whether it is the last number string by judging whether there is still number behind this string
        * If so, it is not the last string, and you need to output a SPACE.
        *********************************************************************************************************************/
        for(size_t i = 0; i < length; ++i){
            if(str[i] >= '0' && str[i] <= '9'){
                size_t index = i;
                while(str[index] >= '0' && str[index] <= '9'){
                    putchar(str[index]);
                    ++index;
                }
                size_t inspect_back = index;
                while((str[inspect_back] < '0' || str[inspect_back] > '9') && inspect_back < length - 1){
                    ++inspect_back;
                    if(str[inspect_back] >= '0' && str[inspect_back] <= '9')
                        if_final = false;
                }
                if(!if_final) putchar(' ');
                i = index;
                if_final = true;
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```



### Problem 2 Wrong drink

#### Original problem: 

Give you several kinds of wine, the density is $d_i$, the price is $p_i$. Now input a series of densities, the program should output the lowest cost.

(Source code: https://oj.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/course/8/contest/170/problem/1)

#### Solution:

1. The idea of the source code is treating pairs ($d_i$, $p_i$) as a point of a 2-dimensional surface, find the convex hull, and pick two wines on the hull.

2. Bugs in the idea:

(1) The automatically called constructor and destructor: HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE

```c++
#include <iostream>

class NewClass{
public:
    NewClass(){std::cout << "Constructor !" << std::endl; }
    ~NewClass(){std::cout << "Destructor !" << std::endl; }
};

int main(){
    printf("Object:\n");
    NewClass cls;
    printf("\n");
    
    printf("Pointer:\n");
    NewClass* ptr1;
    printf("\n");
    
    printf("New a pointer:\n");
    NewClass* ptr2 = new NewClass();
    printf("\n");
    
    // delete ptr2;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```console
Object:
Constructor !

Pointer:

New a pointer:
Constructor !

Destructor !
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

Here we can find that if we just declare a pointer, both the two functions won't be called automatically.

If you new a pointer, the constructor will be called automatically, while the destructor won't.

If you declare an object, both the two functions will be called automatically.

Therefore we conclude that the automatically-called mechanism only works for objects. For pointer, sorry, you need to operate them manually.

(2) Special situations

Sometimes the new wine can't be made: the minimum density is larger than the given density or the maximum density is smaller than given density. We need to deal with them seperately.

My source code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <memory>


using namespace std;

// A bottle of wine
typedef pair<int, int> dpair;

// Node
/***********************************************
 * Initialized value = 0;
 * Counter = 0 <===> Nope or destroyed
 * Counter = 1 <===> Created
************************************************/
struct Wine {
    int d, p;
    Wine* last;
    static int counter;
    Wine() { ++counter; }
    ~Wine() { --counter; }
};
int Wine::counter = 0;

/*****************************************************************
 * Memory inspector, NO MODIFYING !!!!
 * It will be destroyed when the programme ends,
 * If counter != 0, it means that the wine is not destructed
 *****************************************************************/
struct Checker {
    int _;
    ~Checker() { if (Wine::counter != 0) cout << "你的对象没有正确释放!\n"; }
} _c;


int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    int n, m;
    vector<dpair> wines;
    vector<int> qs;
    
    // Input n,m and the density & price of each bottle of wine
    // Create a wine shelf
    cin >> n >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int d, p;
        cin >> d >> p;
        wines.push_back(dpair(d, p));
    }
    
    // Sort according to density
    sort(wines.begin(), wines.end());

    // Create a new list
    Wine* phead = nullptr;
    Wine* temp = nullptr;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Read in wine[i], you can say q = the corresponding struct node
        auto q = new Wine;
        q->d = wines[i].first;
        q->p = wines[i].second;
        // If two wines have the same value of d, discard the one whose q is bigger
        if ( phead && phead->d == q->d) q->~Wine();
        
        // If phead and its tail aren't NULL
        while (phead != nullptr && phead->last != nullptr) {
            // Compare slope factor, delete the nodes away from the list
            // Convert the denominator to double type to avoid singular point 
            if ((q->p - phead->p) / (double)(q->d - phead->d) <=
                (phead->p - phead->last->p) /(double)(phead->d - phead->last->d)){
                temp = phead;
                phead = phead->last;
                temp->~Wine();
            }
            else break;
        }
        
        // If phead isn't NULL or phead doesn't match q
        // The first loop go to here
        if (!phead || q->d != phead->d) {
            q->last = phead;
            phead = q;
        }
    }

    // Use vector to search
    wines.clear();
    for (auto i = phead; i; i = i->last) {
        wines.push_back(dpair(i->d, i->p));
    }
    // Delete the list
    for (auto i = phead; i; i = i->last) {
        i->~Wine();
    }
    reverse(wines.begin(), wines.end());

    
    cout.setf(ios::fixed);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int q;
        cin >> q;
        
        // Find the point which is the nearest to the the lowest hull
        // Here price is initialized to 0
        if((wines[0].first > q) || (wines[wines.size() - 1].first < q))
            cout << -1 << endl;
        else{
            auto it = lower_bound(wines.begin(), wines.end(), dpair(q, 0));
            auto ib = it - 1;
            double res = (it->first - q) / (double)(it->first - ib->first) * ib->second;
            res += (q - ib->first) / (double)(it->first - ib->first) * it->second;
            cout << setprecision(2) << res << endl;        
        }
    }
}
```

#### Acknowledgement:

Thanks for Zhixiao Xiong(熊志潇，未央工-11)'s help, after several days' debugging, we finally found the reason why the object couldn't be released correctly.
