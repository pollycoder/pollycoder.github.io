GPOPS-II is a MATLAB software based on Gauss pseudo-spectral method, mainly used on solving optimal control problems (OCP). This blog is a summary of the documentation of GPOPS-II, including the structure of the program and frequently-used parameters, mainly based on my own projects completed with GPOPS-II.

# Program Structure of GPOPS-II

1. Continuous function: Dynamics equations

```matlab
function phaseout = ContinuousFunc(input)
```

Components of input:

- `input.phase(p).time`: time vector for $p^{th}$ phase, $len=N^{(p)}$
- `input.phase(p).state`: state matrix for $p^{th}$ phase, $size=N^{(p)}\times n_y^{(p)}$
- `input.phase(p).control`: control matrix for $p^{th}$ phase, $size=N^{(p)}\times n_u^{(p)}$
- `input.phase(p).parameter`: static parameter for $p^{th}$ phase, $size=N^{(p)}\times n_s$

Components of output

3. Endpoint function: 

```matlab
function output = EndpointFunc(input)
```
