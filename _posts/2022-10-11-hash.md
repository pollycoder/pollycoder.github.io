# Original Problem

Create a dataset. Achieve three functions:

1. Insert: put one element into the dataset.
1. Delete: delete all the corresponding elements from the dataset.
1. Search: check the dataset to search for certain element. If it exists, return 1; if not, return 0.

> The real purpose of this problem is asking you to create a hash table. If not, the time complexibility will become $O(n^2)$. You will receive "Time limitation exceeded". If you use hash table, the time complexity will become $O(n)$.

Solution:
	Create a hash table to reduce time complexibility

Special acknowledgement for Qiyang Sun:
	At first I didn't want to spend much time to learn hash, but she encouraged me to use hash.
	Without her insistance, I would have given up solving this problem.

Reminder:
	This is a simplified version of hash table.
	Hash function is quite simple, and I didn't put collision resolution here.

> My idea: <br>In a hash table, there is a list of slots for putting in new data, and a list of keys. For example, in Python, `dictionary` is a special hash table (1$\to$1 type). It seems like classifying your inputs into different drawers, and if you need to pick them up, you need to search the corresponding drawer only according to the keys you've got. Therefore, the time cost is reduced by one dimension.
