# Original Problem

Create a dataset. Achieve three functions:

1. Insert: put one element into the dataset.
1. Delete: delete all the corresponding elements from the dataset.
1. Search: check the dataset to search for certain element. If it exists, return 1; if not, return 0.

> The real purpose of this problem is asking you to create a hash table. If not, the time complexibility will become $O(n^2)$.
