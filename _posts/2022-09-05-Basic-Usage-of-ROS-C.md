# How to Complete CMakeLists.txt and package.xml

In ROS developing, `CMakelists.txt` and `package.xml` are two important files to build a package. Only the files under your package direcotry need to be modified. Since you are not sure what dependencies you are going to use at the beginning, therefore in real developing process the `CMakeLists.txt` and `package.xml` writing can't be done completely by `catkin_create_pkg`.

## CMakeLists.txt

#### Here are several basic commands:

| Function                  | Command                                                      | Usage                                                        |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment Configuration | `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION x.x.x)`                      | Set up the minimum version of CMake installed on your computer |
| Environment Configuration | `project(xxx)`                                               | Package name (<font color=gree>automatiaclly generated by ROS</font>) |
| Find dependencies         | `find_package(XX REQUIRED xxx)`                              | Normally `catkin` is necessary                               |
| Add executable targets    | `add_executable(EXEC FILES)`                                 | EXEC-executable file name; FILES-all compilation units (.cpp) |
| Add target library        | `add_library(LIB FILES)`                                     | LIB-library name; FILES-all compilation units (.cpp)         |
| Link libraries            | `target_link_libraries(EXEC LIB)`                            | EXEC-executable file name;LIB-library name                   |
| Include header files      | `target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)` | CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR=PACKAGE/src                         |

<font color=gree>Tips:</font>

<font color=gree>Here we find that somewhere has</font> `#` <font color=gree>commented, somewhere has</font> `##` <font color=gree>commented, somewhere has no comment. </font>

<font color=gree>This a small trick:</font>

<font color=gree>No comment---------This part is indispensible. You'd better not comment them or your project can't be made.</font>

`#` <font color=gree>commented------This part is optional, you can uncomment them when you need.</font>

`##`<font color=gree> commented-----This part is the real comment. Don't uncomment them.</font>
